SF communities - its nothing but the social platform which designed for employees, partner or even the customer can login into the SF and do some kind of a communication
example : uberEats - there two kind of employee 
                     1. permanant employee (cutomer servive) / Developer
                        lets consider customer service are using SF and they can directly login into the salesforce and can do the stuffs they want 
                        means they can access the data of customer like what customer has order the data, at what time, what price and history at one place
                        and Developer has access to salesforce as kind of admin                     
                     2. Delivery Partner/contractor 
                        we cannot give direct access to Delivery/hotel partner to SF because they are not employee they work on their own condition
                        instead we build a seperate UI
communities is kind of UI, it is nothing but the extention or a part of salesforce in which a customer can do stuffs in the salesforce using UI.

Q. what is point where you use a communities?
>  ex. if i was build a system where all the people who are managing the gas station, I need to provide a portal to people who are running the gas station
       so I will have one salesforce Org where customer service is going to login
       and the person who is running the gas station will have seperate UI.
