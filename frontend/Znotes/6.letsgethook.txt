default import and Named import

import * as obj from "./component/Header"
// * means everything is imported
obj.Header
obj.Title

* create config file || constant 
// we will put all the hardcoded things into my config file why?


* state, hook 
state =  variable
hook = react function =? normal js function

<h1>
<h2>
<p>false</p>
<span>
<div>

setState(true)

very very important

==>>> every time state changes our whole component will re-renders but updates only specific portion which has changed => Reconcilation is happeining
diff algorithm is being use to updates specific portion instead of whole dom this is why react is so fast

even if component re-renders it will only update changed part, it is like git diff

what is actually a virtual DOM - it is actual a object

why react is fast?
bxoz of it fast dom manipluation => how it is done using diff algorithm it compares  both the tree


updating direct dom is very expensive

you can use normal variable if you don't want to change that variable else you need to use useState
