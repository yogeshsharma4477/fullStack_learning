virtaul dom - it is not just about react, it a software engineering thing
Representation of a real dom
why do we need? = for Reconcilation
Reconcilation - Reconcilation is an algorithm(diff algorithm) which react uses to diff one tree(actual dom) from another(virtual dom), 
and its determinds whats need to change and what not in UI.
and this process is known as Reconcilation

diff algorithm finds out the differnce between one tree and other 
now if we have found out the differnce it will only update that portion 
//it is kind of git diff
