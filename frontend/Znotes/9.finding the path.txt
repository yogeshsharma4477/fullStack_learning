//Never create a component inside of a component bcoz component renders inside component will be created after every render, it is very bad practice
//Never create a useState inside if or loop becoz it leads to inconsistency

why is cdn a great place to store an images? 
>it cache your images
>it return your image very fast
>it optimizes thing
>it has 100% up time
>even swiggy uses cdn
>when we put our images in cdn it alredy stored in an optimized way

Formik -> for form building

/==========ROUTE =========/ recat Router dom 

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter({
    //this is place where i will tell if there is /about in my browser load About us page
    {
        errorElement:<Error /> // whaterer component we give to this node it will render incase of error
    }
})

react-router-dom has RouterProvider component

//create our error page

//react-router-dom also give us {useRouteError} hook

const error = useRouteError() // this hook give information about our error


/==========Nested ROUTE =========/ recat Router dom 

- anchor tag referesh the page so react-route-dom come up with LINK

2 types of routing
1>client side routing // we sre doing csr
2>server side routing

import { LINK } from 'react-route-dom'

<LINK to='/' /> // behind the scene it is using href only bcoz browser under href

Q - what if i need to load my about page between header and footer?
// react-router-dom give use outlet component <outlet />
// i want always my header and footer in my application to we use oulet it will be filed with children configuration
const Applayout = () => {
    return(
        <header>
        <outlet/> //will be field with children configuration
        <footer>
    )
}

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path:'/',
        element:<Applayout/>
        errorElement: <Error />
        children : [
            {
                path:'/',
                element: <Body />
            },
            {
                path:'/about',  // '/' slash means from the root
                element: <About />,
                children:[{
                    path:"Profile",         //for this to render create <outlet /> inside it parent component in this case About.js is the parent
                    element: <Profile />
                }]
            },
            {
                path:'/contact',
                element: <Contact />
            }
        ]
    }
])

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />)


/==========Dynamic ROUTE =========/ recat Router dom 

{
    path:'/RestaurantMenu/:id',
    element: <RestaurantMenu />
}

Q> how to ready Dynamic id from url in component?
a) import { useParams } from "react-router-dom" //hook
    const params = useParams()

//create Dynamic RestaurantMenu using api, pass id from url 

<LINK to=`/RestaurantMenu/${data.data.id}`>
    <RestaurantCard />
</LINK>

//inside RestaurantMenu component
 import { useParams } from "react-router-dom" //hook
    const params = useParams()


    why using Link tag dosen't reload the page instead of href?
    > User click in Link tag --- > react router prevents the browser from navigating to the new page and fetching new index.html file but url still changes
     'History' object sees updated url and send it to createBrowserRouter
     createBrowserRouter communicate the url to route component
     route component renders the linked components
