react is one way data binding
but we can send data from child to parent using a function ,
pass function from parent to child or we can build custom hooks

lifting the state up

Context - like a central store,
// updating the localstorage is an heavy operation, instead use context, redux

to create context ---> react gives us a hook { createContext } from 'react'
to use context ---> { useContext }

//createContext(defaultValue) is a function which take some data that need to be access all across the application

    const UserContext = createContext({
        user : {
        name:"dummy name",
        email:"yogesh@gmail"
        }
    })

    UserContext.displayName --> just for debugging

    export default UserContext

// how can i use UserContext 

    import { useContext } from 'react'
    import UserContext from './UserContext'

    const { user } = useContext(UserContext)



    <UserContext.Porvider value={{value:"data", state:state, setState:setState}} >
    <component Which will use the value from Porvider>
    </UserContext.Porvider>
