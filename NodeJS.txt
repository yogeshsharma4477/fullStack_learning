Q. Put vs Patch 
> The PUT method is used to replace an existing resource entirely with a new one.
  The PATCH method is used to make partial updates to an existing resource.


Q. security Implementation in nodejs services?
> 1. Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent common attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection
  2. we can use Helmet middleware 
  3. authenication and authorization
  4. cors
  5. maintaing logs and email trigger if any inconsistence happen

Q. how to make API fast?
> 1. Caching:
    Utilize caching mechanisms like Redis or in-memory caching to store frequently accessed data and reduce response times
  2. Optimized Database Queries:
    Optimize database queries by indexing, using query optimization techniques, and avoiding N+1 queries to enhance response speed
  3.Asynchronous Processing:
    Implement asynchronous processing using tools like Promises, async/await, or libraries like Bluebird to handle multiple tasks concurrently and improve response times
  4. CDN Integration:
    Integrate Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to cache static assets closer to users geographically, reducing latency and speeding up content delivery


Q. sql injection
> const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? and mobile= ?';
  connection.execute(query, [userInput, mobileInput], (error, results) => {
    // Handle the results
  });
  // what this is do is if in any input it find and execute commond or ; it it will break it there only and wont be able to attack

Q. how to enable Cors
> const cors = require('cors');
  const app = express();

  // Define CORS options for specific URLs
  const corsOptions = {
    origin: ['http://specificurl1.com', 'http://specificurl2.com'],
  };

  // Enable CORS with specific options
  app.use(cors(corsOptions));
  // Enable CORS for all requests
  app.use(cors());


Q. common middleware used
> body-parser: Parse HTTP request body.
  compression: Compress HTTP responses.
  cors: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
  cookie-parser: Parse cookie header.
  errorhandler: Development error-handling/debugging.
  morgan: HTTP requests logger.
  multer: Handle multi-part form data.

====================================================DAY 2 ============================================================

Q. Event Loop
> EVENT LOOP - Execution Order
     microtask queue 1. nextTick queue
                     2. promise queue
    3. timer queue
    4. I/O queue 
    5. check queue
    6. close queue

Q.when to use sql and nosql? how to optimise sql query(can use indexing)
> no-sql should be use when your application is more of readablilty ex. match score
  and sql should be used when you have a big data and there are many updates concurrently ex. banking

Q. clusturing
Q. child Process
Q. protoype chaining
Q. Generator
=======================================week2 ============================================
Q What is Nodejs 
Q.is Node js single threaded? 
Q. HTTP method
Q. how do we hit servers? we have backend urls for every server
Q. ROUTES - whatever we have after the basePath /users defines the route ex. if we want to access users data from backend we do like www.backend.com/users
Q.  how to do we expose our code to the world, there is where we need http server
    and there are alot of library that let you write very easily http server
>   express is one the library which let you create http server very easily

//fs comes with nodejs and there are alot of library that let you write very easily http server
1. Query Params, Headers and body are three ways to send some data to backend 
    > Query Params - www.localhost:3000/route?queryParam=data, req will have queryParams, req.query
    > dynamicParam - app.req('/:username') - req.query.username

2.Request methods > GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE
3. URL route
4. STATUS code

========================================= DAY 4 SQL =======================================

why choose nodejs
> for I/O operation
  for event emmitter
