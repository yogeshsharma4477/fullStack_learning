Trpc - rpc means remote procedure calls
       In our backend system generally even in leetcode you writing function is also called as procedure
       and if I call a function remotely is called remote procedure calls 

       your client in a react application instead of calling API for createUser he can directly call a remote function which does internally calls a https server where 
       user or the client does not need to worry about which method to pass or body or header.
       You just call the createUser function which does underline the http call which you as a application developer don't have to worry about that is what the remote procedure calls are for
       there are various libray which lets you create rpc one which are using is Trpc
       another libray is grpc which is writen by google which almost do the same thing like on your server you create a function and on your client you simply use that function

Trpc - Typescript remote procedure calls 

Q. Why Trpc
> 1. Automatic types on FE and BE. you write your type in the backend code once you get very nice type at your frontend 
  2. Genric code that can be converted to express backend and Nextjs
     How does it do or convert express to nextjs backend?
     > Adapters:
        suppose your a company like express, you can write an adapter and any Trpc application can be converted to your backend
        So you as a application developer simply wrote Trpc code and you define nicely that this is my function and this is input and this is the output 
        and when you are serving it, you need to defined it that you want to serve your Trpc as a express or nextjs so Trpc is the code which never runs on your server
        and this auto conversion is done by the Trpc compiler/Adapters. your end user interact with express server or nextjs server
