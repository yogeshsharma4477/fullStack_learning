Q. Mongoose - mongoose gives APIs which helps connect with database, add database

Q. mongoose.Schema -> Schema, its what your data shape looks like
    - mongodb is Schemaless database and we can add data without mongoose in mongodb 
      but with mongoose.Schema we are restricting means we are saying that only schema shape data will be entered in mongodb

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username : string,
    password : string,
    purchasedCourses : [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId , ref : 'course'}]
                        //it is an array of type id which is a reference to the course 
                        // what this will do is it will only allow ID which is present in course collection
                        // even if we pass whole object to purchasedCourses node it will fetch only the ID and store only the id
})

Q. const user = mongoose.model('user',userSchema)
             // meaning 1st paramter will be collectionName and 2nd paramter will Schema which define shape of collection


Q. Three things to know
1. create Schema
2. create model
3. mongoose.connect('') to connect the mongodb



Q. mongoose also provide bunch of APIs to add update delete save
>   model.find()
    model.findById()
    model.findone()
    model.save() 
    model.findbyIdandUpdate()
