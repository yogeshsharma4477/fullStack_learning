Q. why react, angular were introduced and what was the problem with html,css,javascript
> having js variables putting them into DOM is how the web was build until 2014
    createHtml, removeHtml, appenChild these are the three basics function website uses under the hood to remove add delete

    But React, Veu etc came into the picture to hide these complexicity from the developers
    so now we only need to focus on our state only instead of worry about adding, removing.

    Reconciliation - in general Reconciliation is a process of react or veu taking the update of the state and translating it to the dom by calling appenChild, removeChild

Q. creating Reconciliater of our own?

    function OwnReconciler(data){
            var parentElement = document.getElementById("mainArea");
            parentElement.innerHTML = ''
            for (var i = 0; i<data.length; i++) {
                var childElement = document.createElement("div");
    
                var grandChildElement1 = document.createElement("span");
                grandChildElement1.innerHTML = data[i].title
    
                var grandChildElement2 = document.createElement("span");
                grandChildElement2.innerHTML = data[i].description
    
                var grandChildElement3 = document.createElement("button");
                grandChildElement3.innerHTML = "Delete"
                grandChildElement3.setAttribute("onclick", "deleteTodo(" + data[i].uid + ")")
    
                childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement1)
                childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement2)
                childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement3)
    
                parentElement.appendChild(childElement);
            }
    }

    setInterval(()=>{
        OwnReconciler([{
            title : "go to the gym",
            description : "go to the gym from 5"
            id:1
        }])
    },1000)

    // this is basic Reconciler which appenChild, removeChild but this not an optimal way because
    we have removing every thing and then again adding to the dom.
    to optimize the update we need to compare the diff and update the dom this is exactly react is doing
    main work of react is to add update delete the dom in a very efficient way

Q. create Reconciler with diff check?
