Today:
- Foundation for databases
- Connecting frontend to backend
    AJAX, cors, DOM

Q. three ways to call callbacks
>   Easy (callback)             app.get('/', callback1)
    medium (anoymous function)  app.get('/', function(req, res){})
    Hard (Arrow function)       app.get('/', (req, res) => {})

Q. JSON.parse(data) => "[]" converting this to => [], String, JSON, HTML is send by server

Q. File and DATABASE are ways to store data instead of storing in state becouse if server restarts our state will be cleared but the file is not clear

Q. Connecting to frontend 
>   1. cors
    2. ajax request(fetch)
    3. DOM manipluation

1. cors
> what if chatgpt send request to google backend server, cors error will be thrown
    - if the origin is not same cors error will be thrown, if the origin is same cors will not throw error 
        you can create index.html from backend and send html to client from backend, they will not give cors error becouse we are in same origin 
    - npm install cors    
        in backend app.use(cors()) 
        this way you can tell all browser its fine, let the request come from anywhere
        ** you should never do this in production app **


2. query ?id=1 vs params /:id
