> EcmaScript Standard is a set of common rules which all the browser should follow 
so that all the code written in js should work on all the browser

>Nodejs - Nodejs is a js runtime, it is just the engine which was used in chrome (V8) 
          which was pulled out for the world to everyone to use without the things that you need inside the browser

> higer Order Function
    A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
    function add(index1, index2){
        return index1 + index2
    }
    function sub(index1, index2){
        return index1 - index2
    }
    function div(index1, index2){
        return index1 / index2
    }
    function doArithmetic(index1, index2, arithmecticFun){
        return arithmecticFun(index1,index2)
    }
    
    // naive code
    function doArithmetic(index1, index2, whatToDo){
        if(whatToDo === "sum") return sum(index1,index2)
        if(whatToDo === "sub") return sub(index1,index2)
        if(whatToDo === "divide") return divide(index1,index2)
    }

> Pattern Creation
  1. star Pattern
  function star(n){
        for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            let starStr = ""
            for(let k = n-i; k >=0 ; k--){
                starStr += "-"
            }
            for(let j = 1 ; j < i*2; j++){
                starStr += "*"
            }
            console.log(starStr)
        }
    }

  2. fiboncii series
     function fib(n){
        if(n == 1)return 0
        if(n == 2)return 1
        let i = 2;
        let x = 0;
        let y = 1;
        let z = 0;
        while(i < n){
        z = x + y;
        x = y;
        y = z
        i++
        }
        return y
    }

// replit js online editor - when we run js code it is not running on browser, code goes to replit server and then return the code at frontend.

> where can JS run
    1. browser
    2. Data centers
    3. Flight TV
    4. Mobile Devices

> CORE CONCEPT OF JS
1. Single threaded
    // every computer has cores there can be many cores, the more core you have in your machine the more powerfull is your machine
    // core is like a thread to run programs in your machine

    > now Nodejs was written in a shabby manner like as single threaded(single core to perform all the operation)
    > js and node is single threaded but there are ways to run and 
      if you deloyed your nodejs on a very powerfull server which has many cores it of no use becz nodjs will run on a single core
      that is why people says olang, rust, java is faster than js

2. Asynchronous
    Asynchronous task don't generally run on the same thread as js is running
    callbacks helps us to achive async task
    sync means not creating the different thread it means 

3. Loosly type 

3. Interpreted vs compile type
    Interpreted means line by line, it directlt start executing
    compiled means first it will compile it is not even executed our code yet
