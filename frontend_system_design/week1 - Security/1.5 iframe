iframe - you can load any other website in your web application
and what if the other website you are loading or ads you are loading in your website try to steal your website credential?

Vunerability
- clickhijacking - 
- data theft - using document.innerHTML
- cookie and session theft - using window.cookie but modern browser doesn't allow to share any data to other origin

Mitigation
- using Headers 
            - suppose I don't want to inject my website to any other web app using iframe
              set Headers 
                - X-Frame-Options   X-Frame-Options: DENY
                                    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
                - CSP: frame-ancestor
                    res.setHeader('content-Security-Policy', 'frame-ancestors "self"')

 once you set this header no one will be able to run your website using iframe

- Sandbox iframe 
- setting cookie - set httpOnly: true
                       secure: true // cookie will be send to the client if the client is https 
                       sameSite: 'strict' // if you trying to access data from another domain your cookie will not be travelled
