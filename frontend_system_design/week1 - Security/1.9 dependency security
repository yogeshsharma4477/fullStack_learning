Q. so when you use any library you need verify that its internally packages are secure? you need to be aware of these 5 things when you are using any external library.
> 1. we should have Regular Audit of dependencies.
     how do we do it?
     npm Audit, npm update
  2. Enforce Auditing  
    so genrally you don't keep checking that you dependencies are up todate  or npm Audit
    so what you can do is : npm set audit true
  3. code and dependency monitor -  using codegl CI
  4. dependency locking - package-lock.json
     - suppose you understood that this package is stable now you can just lock the version so every time you do npm i you will get the stable version of dependency
  5. security penetration testing

  Development is one part but enhancing that one part you remain stable even after 5 years makes you developer/engineer to the next level
  I also take care of dependency security and management
