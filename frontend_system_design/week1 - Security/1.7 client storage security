Q. How do we store the sensitive data on client?
> ex. credential, api keys/token
    1. the best way is to store data on the server.
    2. In case you can't do that, encrypt data for ex. bysciptjs
    3. token expiry in localstorage
        ex. const token = generateToken();
            localstorage.setItem('token',token)
            setTimeout(() => {
                localstorage.remove('token')
            }, tokenExpirationTime)
        limitition - it won't work if browser close before expiration 
        but in worst case you can do this there's no option

Q. how to have right set of Authenication?
>  1. use JWT/OAuth 
   2. session token expiry
   3. multi factor Authenication

Q. Data Integrity
> suppose you are storing the data in localstorage with data encryption and fetching the data by dcrypting it 
  now suppose someone find out the encryption technique which you are using it it can be security issue.
  how to solve this?
  1. create a checksum 

Q. Storage Limit 
> we basically have 5 to 10 mb size of Storage for localstorage
  we have localstorage(5-10mb), sessionStorage(5-10mb), IndexedDB(50mb -100mb), cookie(4kb-20kb), cache(upto 100mb)
  if you don't handle data storage properly it can lead to data loss.


Q. Session Management
> Token should have httoOnly: Secure
