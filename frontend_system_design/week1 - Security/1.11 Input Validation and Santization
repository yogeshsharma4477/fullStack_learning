Q. Input Validation and Sanitization
> use Framework library - like react these automatically handles output validation like if any malicious js script is there it won't run
                          but still you should take because you some time use dangerouslyHTML
  Whitelist validation 
  Regular expresion - to insure user only enters data which comes under regular expresion
  Escape user input - restrict some keyword
  Parameterized URLs - like validate the datatype
  Lenght and size check - so that attacker script should not execute because it won't match with our
  Image & File type check - like if you are expecting png then add png check
  Add client side validation - because it might happen that server script be XXS attack
  Error Handling - handle global exception

  Avoid using third-party library - because it might happen the library which you are using it can stop maintain by the owner
