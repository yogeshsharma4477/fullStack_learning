Q. Internal  Packages in Turborepo vs external package?
> like before when people want to share Packages they create a package and deployed to npm registries 
  and then other packages in frontend can pick it up from npm

  the difference `between Internal and external package is:
  Internal packages are packages which are only to be used inside your monorepo. theyre extremely usefull for sharing code between apps in closed-source monorepo.
  Internal package quick to create and can be turned into external packages if you end up wanting to publish them to npm.

  Summary:
  Any packages which does not have build as a commond in their package.json is concider as Internal package
  And whenever there is internal you have to make sure whoever is using it, it should me mention in config file in nextjs else next will fail
