Q> app.use(express.json()) 
json() is a built-in middleware function in Express. 
This method is used to parse the incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based upon the bodyparser. 
This method returns the middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at the requests where the content-type header matches the type option.

from frontend we are not passing the json we pass multipart/form-data
and to parse form-data we need to use middleware(express.urlencoded || express.json()) which will allow us to parse form-data


Q> Multer
app.post('/profile', upload.single('avatar'), function (req, res, next) {
  // req.file is the `avatar` file, avatar is node name||name attribute from FE which is comming from frontend
  // req.body will hold the text fields, if there were any
})

> multer.diskStorage({}) object accept 2 key value pair 1. destination 2. filename
  const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, '/tmp/my-uploads') // this cb function accept 2 parameter, 1. is error 2. path in which file will upload
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9)
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix)
  }
})

const upload = multer({ storage: storage })
